/*
You are given an m x n matrix mat where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Your task is to find the smallest common element in all rows. If there is no common element, return -1.

Input Format:
--------------
Line-1: Two integers m and n, representing the number of rows and columns, respectively.
Line-2: The next m lines contain n space-separated integers each, representing the elements of the matrix. Each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Output Format:
---------------
Line-1: Print a single integer, the smallest common element in all rows. If no common element exists, print -1.

Constraints:
-------------
1 ≤ m, n ≤ 500
1 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 10^4
Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Sample Input-1:
----------------
3 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 5 7
3 5 6 7

Sample Output-1:
-----------------
3

Explanation: The number 3 is the smallest common element in all rows.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
2 3
1 2 3
4 5 6

Sample Output-2:
----------------
-1

Explanation: There is no common element in all rows, so the output is -1.
