/*
Given a directed graph represented by an adjacency matrix, where each entry graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. If graph[i][j] is 0, it means there is no direct edge between i and j.

Your task is to determine the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, representing the number of vertices in the graph.
Next-N lines: Each line contains N space-separated integers representing the adjacency matrix graph.
Last-line: An integer src, representing the source vertex.

Output Format:
--------------
A line that says: "Vertex 		Distance from Source".
Followed by N lines, each containing the vertex number and its shortest distance from the source.

Constraints:
------------
*1 <= N <= 100
*0 <= graph[i][j] <= 1000
*0 <= src < N
*All weights are non-negative integers.
