/*
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. 
Your task is to split nums into k non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. You need to return the minimized largest sum of the split.

Input Format:
--------------
Line-1: Integers representing the elements of the array nums, separated by commas.
Line-2: An integer k, representing the number of subarrays to split nums into.

Output Format:
---------------
Line-1: Print a single integer representing the minimized largest sum after splitting the array into k subarrays.

Constraints:
-------------
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000
0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ k ≤ min(50, nums.length)

Sample Input-1:
---------------
7,2,5,10,8
2

Sample Output-1:
----------------
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays. The best way is to split it into [7, 2, 5] and [10, 8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
1,2,3,4,5
2

Sample Output-2:
----------------
9

Explanation:
The best way to split nums into two subarrays is [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5], where the largest sum is 9.
